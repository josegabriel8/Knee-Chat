This project analyzes patient interview data to uncover topics and clusters that can inform and improve pre-surgery communication between doctors and patients. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project identifies key themes from qualitative responses, enabling healthcare providers to better address patient concerns and needs.

Key features include:

Data Processing: Cleaning and preparing interview transcripts for analysis.
Topic Modeling: Extracting thematic clusters from patient responses using NLP techniques (e.g., LDA, BERTopic).
Visualization: Creating interpretable outputs (e.g., topic distributions, word clouds) for healthcare professionals.
Impact: Providing actionable insights to enhance understanding and trust in patient-doctor interactions.

This repository is part of a research initiative aimed at improving patient experiences and optimizing communication strategies in the Hospital Costa Del Sol, Marbella.
